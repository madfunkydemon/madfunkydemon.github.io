Sometimes you need to use the operating system file manager rather than a terminal so a quick way of opening it can be seen below. For the Windows command line:

`explorer .`

The OS X terminal:

`open .`

The Ubuntu console:

`nautilus .`

This will work for parent folders &quot;..&quot; as well as current directory. Note, in case you are interested to do the same in Haiku OS just use the OS X version.
